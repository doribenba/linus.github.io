# Linus Torvalds Website Project

This website was created as a school project to practice HTML and CSS. I decided to make a minimal website about Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux and Git. The site includes:

- A page with basic information about Linus Torvalds.
- A simple contact page with my email for inquiries.

The goal was to keep the design clean and straightforward while learning how to do basic HTML.
